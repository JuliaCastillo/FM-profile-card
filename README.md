## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

- Using Flexbox with Bootstrap
- To center something inside the body, set body to a height of 100%
- The magic of margin auto

### Continued development

I think there must be a better way to overlap and position the profile picture with half of it on top of the picture without just using margin and absolute position, and I intend to find out how!

Also for some reason there is some space between the profile picture and its border, and setting padding to zero didn't help. I've seen the same problem on other people's solutions, so looks like I'm not the only one.
